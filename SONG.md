# The Ballad of Peon-Ping: A Windows Saga

*An epic tavern song in five verses, a chorus, a bridge, and a grand finale.*
*To be performed with drums, tankards, and at least one orc voice.*

---

## Prologue
[A lone lute begins to play in a dimly lit tavern. A bard clears his throat.]

> *Gather 'round, ye coders brave, ye DevOps knights and more,*
> *I'll sing the tale of Peon-Ping, a legend of the lore.*
> *Of how a humble Warcraft sound crossed oceans, crossed the sea,*
> *From Apple's walled garden fair... to Windows, wild and free.*

---

## Verse I - The macOS Days
[Gentle harp, the sound of a distant `osascript` call]

In the ancient lands of macOS, where `bash` scripts ruled the night,
A developer sat coding, bathed in Retina backlight.
`afplay` would call the peons when the CI had returned,
AppleScript showed notifications — oh, those were days discerned.

But the dev looked out the window at a world beyond the Dock,
Where PowerShell lay waiting like a blue-and-white warlock.
"Something need doing?" whispered fate across the terminal divide,
And so began the porting quest — with courage as their guide.

---

## Verse II - The Crossing to Windows
[War drums begin. The sound of a Windows startup chime echoes.]

They left the shores of Cupertino, sailed through Bootcamp's gate,
Past the Isle of WSL where Linux met its fate.
Through the Straits of Registry Keys, the Swamp of `.dll`,
Past ancient Blue Screen graveyards where a thousand systems fell.

[Peon voice] *"Ready to work!"*

The peon's voice rang out across the NTFS terrain,
`SoundPlayer` replaced `afplay`, and nothing was the same.
Toast notifications rose like smoke from PowerShell's great forge,
A `BurntToast` module summoned — *magnifique!* — by George!

---

## Chorus
[Everyone raises their tankards. SLAM them on the table on each "WORK, WORK!"]

> **WORK, WORK! The peon sings!**
> **Through PowerShell, notification rings!**
> **From bash to `.ps1`, the code still flows,**
> **Claude writes it all — mais personne ne le sait!**
>
> **WORK, WORK! The build is done!**
> **Toast pops up like the morning sun!**
> **"Okie dokie!" cries the orc with glee,**
> **Peon-Ping on Windows — c'est la vie!**

[Tankards SLAM]

## Verse III - The PowerShell Forge
[Rhythmic anvil strikes. A blacksmith hammering blue steel.]

In the forge of PowerShell, where `$variables` glow with might,
Where `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` lets you code into the night,
The craftsman shaped a hook script — `peon.ps1`, its name —
A sentinel that watches every Claude Code commit and claim.

`Register-EngineEvent` — the ancient Windows rite,
`[System.Media.SoundPlayer]` to make the peon's voice ignite.
`New-BurntToast` for the banners floating o'er the taskbar's crown,
With `AppLogo` of a peon face — vert, with a permanent frown.

[Peon voice] *"What you want?"*

Les variables d'environnement, configured with such care,
`PEON_SOUNDS_DIR` pointing to the `.wav` files hidden there.
Each hook event — `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, and the rest —
Triggers peon quotes at random. C'est un vrai treasure chest!

---

## Verse IV - Claude, the Tireless Scribe
[Mystical synth pads. An ethereal AI hum.]

While mortals sleep and dream of bugs they cannot reproduce,
Claude toils in the terminal, an engine of produce.
It reads the code, it writes the fix, it refactors with such grace,
Then Peon-Ping announces: *"WORK COMPLETE!"* — right in your face.

[Peon voice] *"Me busy, leave me alone!"*

Ah, but Claude ne dort jamais, this digital orc so keen,
The finest code companion that the world has ever seen.
It writes your tests, it finds your bugs, it even writes this song,
And when the task is finished — DING! — the peon plays along.

[Crowd murmurs in awe]

You step away to grab un cafe, a croissant, or some cheese,
Return to find your PR merged, your linter fully pleased.
The toast upon your screen declares in letters bold and bright:
**"Task Complete. The peon rests. Bonne nuit. Good night."**

---

## Bridge
[The music drops to a whisper. A single drum beats slowly.]

But hark... not all was glory on this Windows-paved road.
There were trials. There were errors. There was missing episode.

*The Notification That Never Came...*

[Spoken word, dramatic]

> You set the hook. You trust the script.
> You walk away. The build has shipped.
> But Windows Defender ate your `.ps1`,
> And Peon-Ping... was gone. C'est done.
>
> No toast. No sound. No orcish cry.
> Just silence in the Task Bar sky.
> You missed the merge. You missed the test.
> You missed the bug that killed the rest.
>
> [Long pause]
>
> And somewhere, in the `/sounds` directory,
> A `.wav` file weeps: *"Me not that kind of orc..."*

[A single tear rolls down the bard's cheek]

---

## Verse V - The Triumphant Return
[FULL ORCHESTRA. Drums, horns, electric guitar. The tavern ERUPTS.]

But the developer rose! With `install.ps1` in hand!
They added the script to Windows Defender's exclusion band!
They set the `CLAUDE_HOOK` path, they configured every sound,
And Peon-Ping on Windows was reborn — safe and sound!

[Peon voice] *"Okie dokie!"*

Now every `git commit` rings out with orcish pride,
Every `PreToolUse` announces Claude is by your side.
The terminal glows blue with PowerShell's electric flame,
And every dev who installs it will never code the same.

Un install script pour monter, un uninstall pour descendre,
`config.json` pour les braves qui veulent tout comprendre.
Random peon quotes at every hook, a symphony of green,
The greatest notification system that the world has seen!

---

## Final Chorus
[MAXIMUM VOLUME. The entire tavern stands. Tankards raised to the heavens.]

> **WORK, WORK! The peon sings!**
> **Through PowerShell, notification rings!**
> **From bash to `.ps1`, the code still flows,**
> **Claude writes it all — mais personne ne le sait!**
>
> **WORK, WORK! The build is done!**
> **Toast pops up like the morning sun!**
> **"Okie dokie!" cries the orc with glee,**
> **Peon-Ping on Windows — c'est la vie!**
>
> [Key change up, drums double-time]
>
> **WORK, WORK! We code all night!**
> **Blue Screen of Death? We'll win that fight!**
> **"Something need doing?" — OUI, TOUJOURS!**
> **Peon-Ping forever — pour l'amour du code!**

[Tankards SHATTER against the floor]

---

## Epilogue
[The lute returns, soft and gentle. The tavern quiets.]

> *So if you code on Windows, friend, and miss those macOS days,*
> *Install the Peon-Ping, and hear the orc's familiar phrase.*
> *For every task that Claude completes, for every build that's won,*
> *A peon's voice will tell you true:*
>
> [Peon voice, one final time]
>
> ***"Work, work... job's done."***

---

[The bard bows. The crowd erupts in applause. Someone in the back shouts "ZUG ZUG!" A peon `.wav` plays from a mysterious laptop in the corner. Fade to black.]

---

*Composed by the Peon-Ping Bard, powered by Claude, in the Year of Our Build 2026.*
*Dedicated to every developer who has ever missed a notification.*

*"Me not that kind of orc!" — but maybe, just maybe, we all are.*
